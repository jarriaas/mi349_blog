            <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Jarria, and I am a student at Michigan State University. I'm a senior working
                towards my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, anticipating to graduate in May 2024.</p>
            <p>My idea for this website was to create a platform where I share two of my life's greatest pleasures:
                gaming and cooking. As a busy college student, my packed schedule often leaves little room for pursuing
                hobbies.</p>
            <p>My Steam library is overflowing with untouched games while my fridge is left empty for days at a time.
                This website will be used as a place to reignite my passion for gaming while exploring different
                cuisines, as well as provide a space for others to follow my latest game reviews and explore accessible
                culinary dishes</p>
