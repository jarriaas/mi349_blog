        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><img alt="A Picture of Me" src="images/id.png"></p>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Jarria, and I am a student at Michigan State University. I'm a senior working towards my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, anticipating to graduate in May 2024.</p>
        <p>My idea for this website was to create a platform where I share two of my life's greatest pleasures:
        gaming and cooking. As a busy college student, my packed schedule often leaves little room for pursuing hobbies.</p>
        <p>My Steam library is overflowing with untouched games while my fridge is left empty for days at a time. This website will be used as a place to reignite my passion for gaming while exploring different cuisines, as well as provide a space for others to follow my latest game reviews and explore accessible culinary dishes</p>

        <ul>
