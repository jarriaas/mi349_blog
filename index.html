            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/">Grounded Game on Steam</a>

            <p>Grounded was one of those games that has been sitting in my Steam wishlist forever. It was originally
                released for early access in 2020, which is when I started to eye it down to see if it was a good fit
                for me. The game was officially released last year, but it wasn't until recently that I purchased it.
            </p>
            <p>I'm one of those people who only buy games if I have someone to play it with, so I finally bought it when
                I found someone who was willing to go through this game with me. We didn't think much of it as first --
                we play as kids who got shrunk in someone's backyard and must survive. I spent the beginning of the game
                running around confused and lost, but I eventually understood the GUI and was able to progress.</p>
            <p>Once you get the hang of things, the game feels limitless. Even though the map is pre-generated and keeps
                you contained within certain boundaries (in this game it's the fences of a backyard), I feel like there
                is almost infinite content. We already have 45 hours in the game and we're not even 45% of the way done
                exploring. The enemies (which are primarily insects) are insanely well made, each having their own
                attack pattern and locational variance. On top of that, the graphics are breathtakingly beautiful.
                10/10.</p>

            <h3>"Serve" Post - Mushroom Risotto</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://linkedin.com/ashjarria">Ashley Jarria</a></address>

            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/85389/gourmet-mushroom-risotto/">Original Recipe via
                AllRecipes</a>

            <p>Mushroom Risotto is something I started making within the last year. It has grown to be one of my
                favorite foods. This recipe always comes out tasting rich and creamy, and it's definitely worth how much
                time it takes to cook.</p>

            <p>This is the recipe I use:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Ingredient</th>
                    <th>Amount</th>
                    <th>Meijer Cost</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Chicken Broth</td>
                    <td>6 cups</td>
                    <td>$3.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Olive Oil</td>
                    <td>3 tbsp</td>
                    <td>$0.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Mini Bella Mushrooms</td>
                    <td>4 oz</td>
                    <td>$1.75</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Shallots</td>
                    <td>2 Medium</td>
                    <td>$1.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Abrorio Rice</td>
                    <td>1 1/2 cups</td>
                    <td>$2.50</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dry White Wine</td>
                    <td>1/2 cup</td>
                    <td>$1.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Parmesan Cheese</td>
                    <td>1/3 cup</td>
                    <td>$0.75</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Butter</td>
                    <td>2 tbsp</td>
                    <td>$0.25</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>It's very similar to the website I linked above, but I made some minor adjustments to better fit my
                taste. The biggest change is that the original recipe uses 2 pounds of mushrooms. I cut it down to about
                Â¼ of what they suggest because even though I love mushrooms, the amount they use feels very heavy and
                becomes overpowering. I like my risotto to have the rice itself be the main attraction.</p>
            <p>The original recipe also states that the rice itself takes around twenty minutes to cook. This is never
                the case for me -- I always end up sitting in front of my stove for around 30-45 minutes. Maybe my
                apartment's stove isn't of the highest quality or maybe I don't set the temperature high enough, but
                spending this much time on a dish I love is no burden to me. Since this recipe ends up making ~5
                portions (relative to how big my bowl is), that's five days where I wake up in the morning excited
                knowing that I get a delicious meal for dinner. 10/10</p>
